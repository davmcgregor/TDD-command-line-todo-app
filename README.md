### Task

* ACME todo inc.
* Command line todo apps
* Add todos from the command line 
* IDs should automatically be generated on todos
* Complete a todo by typign a command e.g. "DONE" - and giving the program an id of that todo

- Every time a command is written / the program is opened, the list appears
- Every time start the program, the complete list of todos appears
- Every time start the program, see a list of incomplete todos with the option to finish

### Inputs & Outputs

| Input              | Output               |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| ADD "Do the dishes" | program should output updated list including that prompt |

Start -> output list of todos and prompt to ADD or COMPLETE todo

Bonus: store Todos in a separate file, for now memory is ok
